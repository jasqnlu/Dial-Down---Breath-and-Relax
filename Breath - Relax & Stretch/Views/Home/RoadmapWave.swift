// width — the wrong fit here, since RoadmapWaveGeometry.nodeSpacing is a
// fixed constant independent of container width. This snaps to the
// nearest node-*centering* offset instead (see
// RoadmapWaveGeometry.snappedContentOffset, where the actual math lives so
// it can be unit-tested), so a node always lands centered in the viewport
// regardless of how wide that viewport is.
