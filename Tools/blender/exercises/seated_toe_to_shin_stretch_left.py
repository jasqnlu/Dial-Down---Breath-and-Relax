"""Seated Toe-to-Shin Stretch (Left) — muscle-body + skin-head animation.

20-exercise thin-coverage batch, foot family. "Sit toward the edge of a
chair, extend your left leg with your heel on the floor, pull the ball of
your foot and toes back toward your shin." Asymmetric seated leg pose —
the working leg extends straight (thigh -90, shin 0, the same straight-leg
convention left_seated_hamstring_stretch.py/seated_forward_fold.py use),
the other leg stays in the standard seated-in-chair fold. No independent
ankle joint to show the actual toe-pull, same rig limit as the rest of the
foot family — reads through the extended-leg silhouette and the foot
highlight.

Highlight: Left Foot, matching the exercise's tag. Flagged
`animationIsApproximate`.
