"""Left Seated Calf Stretch with Towel — muscle-body + skin-head animation.

20-exercise thin-coverage batch. "Sit on the floor, left leg extended, loop
a towel around the ball of your foot, keeping your knee straight gently pull
the towel to draw your toes back." Floor-sitting base (apply_seated_base,
same as seated_forward_fold.py) with BOTH legs straight (thigh -90, shin 0)
— the exercise doesn't fold the other leg in, unlike the asymmetric hamstring
family. Arms reach forward and down as if holding towel ends; no ankle joint
to show the actual toe-pull (same rig limit as the rest of the foot/calf
family this batch).

Highlight: Left Calves, matching the exercise's tag. Flagged
`animationIsApproximate`.
