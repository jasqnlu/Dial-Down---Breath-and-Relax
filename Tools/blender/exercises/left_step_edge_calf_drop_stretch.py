"""Left Step-Edge Calf Drop Stretch — muscle-body + skin-head animation.

Batch 16. "Ball of the foot on a step edge, heel hanging off, let the heel
drop below step level, knee nearly straight." The actual heel-drop is an
ankle-joint motion this rig can't articulate (no independent ankle/foot
bone), and the standing leg itself barely changes shape (knee stays
straight throughout) — so this is animated as a small forward `hips`... no
independent hip motion is called for either. Kept as a near-static hold
(a subtle body-weight sway via a small `spine` lean, the same device
suboccipital_release_finger_press.py uses to keep an otherwise-static hold
from reading as a frozen frame) with the calf highlighted. Flagged
`animationIsApproximate` — the actual stretch mechanism (ankle
dorsiflexion) isn't shown.

Highlight: Left Calves.
