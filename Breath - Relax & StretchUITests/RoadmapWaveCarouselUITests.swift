/// pages on both RoadmapWave call sites (Home hero, Customize roadmap), with
/// no clipped content at the container edges once paged to an off-center node.
///
/// Paging must be driven via `app.scrollViews.firstMatch.swipeLeft()`, not a
/// raw `XCUICoordinate.press(forDuration:thenDragTo:)` — the latter was tried
/// first and reliably produced a no-op (identical before/after screenshots)
/// against this ScrollView's custom `ScrollTargetBehavior`, even with slow
/// velocity and multiple waypoints. `swipeLeft()` (XCUITest's dedicated
/// scroll-view gesture) reliably registers and pages correctly.
