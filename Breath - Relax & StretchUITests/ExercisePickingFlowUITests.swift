/// Drives the REAL path the feature was built around:
/// Home → Customize → "Add Exercises" → Exercises tab region graph → focus a
/// region → open a satellite group (a PUSHED `ExerciseGroupCorpusSheet`) → tap
/// tiles → switch tabs and back → Done → back on Home with Customize
/// re-presented, carrying the merged exercise list.
///
/// The pushed-destination leg is the point: the picking bar is attached with
/// `.safeAreaInset` and such insets do NOT propagate from a NavigationStack's
/// root to its pushed destinations, so the bar has to be applied on the corpus
/// sheet itself. This test asserts the bar is visible and live on THAT screen,
/// which is exactly the regression a root-only attachment produces.
///
/// Element handles are accessibility identifiers, not visible labels, because
/// the region/group/exercise names all come from seed data and would make the
/// test brittle to content edits: "exerciseCategoryNode", "exerciseGroupNode",
/// "exerciseGridTile", "pickingBarCount".
